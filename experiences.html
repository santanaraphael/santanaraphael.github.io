    At Glean i'm developing applications in a fast paced way, powered in a way by the relational
    approach of design and FastAPI's lean structure. When i joined my first big project was working
    on the new payments microservice, which was a fascinating journey. This time in my career i was
    closer to the planning process for the features than ever.
</p>
<p>
    Also, i was working closely with the Customer Support team to make resolve incidents and evolve
    the payments process.
</p>
<p>
    Aside from this big project, i also work a lot with the other backend projects as well and take part
    in a lot of the technical discussions about what is our future vision for the codebase.

    In 2019 i joined the backend team at Nodis. Alongside the team i developed applications
    from end to end, using Domain Driven Design (DDD) principles and focusing a lot on code
    quality, keeping high code coverage and componentization, using microservices and
    event-driven architecture, as well as some patterns like event sourcing.
</p>
<p>
    There i developed many APIs and workers and created many integrations with partner APIs.
</p>
<p>
    Also, for the first time i engaged more and more in architecture decisions and on mentoring
    new developers.

        <p>
    In 2017 i had my first experience in a tech company. At Walltime, i had contact with all
    the areas in such a company, like customer support, operations and finally software development.
</p>
<p>
    I've dealt with new technologies like Blockchain and also developed a deep understanding
    about how to turn business demands into proper requirements and execute them.
</p>
<p>
    I used Python a lot there, delivering side applications that were used by the operations team,
    and also employed some data analysis to extract certain business KPIs. Another thing was
    a couple of web scrapers that provided invaluable data to the company.
</p>
<p>
    There i was mentored in Software Development the first time, and got the needed guidance to
    keep learning and developing myself.
