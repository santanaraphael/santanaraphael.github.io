    Glean AI is an accounts payable (AP) solution that empowers finance teams with spend intelligence and streamlined
    workflows for their AP needs, including invoice processing, payments, approval workflows, and general ledger
    integrations.
</p>
<p>
    I joined the company during a period of growth, as the team was expanding and the product evolving. Initially, I was
    responsible for envisioning and developing the new Payments product, with support for multiple payments providers.
    This was a valuable opportunity to gain deep insights into the payments ecosystem and apply my knowledge in how to
    seamlessly integrate with various providers.
</p>
<p>
    Another major initiative was breaking down the monolithic application into smaller services, improving developer
    velocity and making the codebase more maintainable. The challenge was to align this technical shift with business
    needs, ensuring that we didn't slow down product development.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, I worked closely with the Customer Success team, implementing monitoring and alerting systems to
    proactively address issues that our customers encountered.
</p>
<h4><b>Key Achievements:</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Developed the Payments product, integrating with multiple payment providers to support ACH, Wire, and Check
        payments.</li>
    <li>Integrated with several General Ledger services, including QuickBooks Online (QBO), Netsuite, and Xero.</li>
    <li>Refactored the monolithic application into smaller services, enhancing developer velocity and maintainability of
        the codebase.</li>
    <li>Collaborated with the Customer Success team to implement monitoring and alerting systems, ensuring swift
        identification and resolution of customer issues.</li>

    Nodis was a platform that connected small retailers to digital marketplaces, enabling them to sell their products
    online to a broader audience.
</p>
<p>
    I joined the company in its early stages and had the experience of building a product from scratch. This allowed me
    to engage in the entire product lifecycle—from ideation to launch and maintenance. I was involved in architectural
    decisions and responsible for developing monitoring and alerting systems.
</p>
<p>
    The engineering team's vision was to build a scalable and reliable product while keeping technical debt to a
    minimum.
    This was achieved by adhering to strict standards for code quality, test coverage, and best practices. I also had
    the
    opportunity to mentor new developers, contributing to the team’s culture and technical growth.
</p>
<h4><b>Key Achievements:</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Developed an ingestion system for product data, refining our catalog and improving search engine quality. The
        catalog
        contained millions of products, updated daily.
    </li>
    <li>Integrated with multiple marketplaces (Amazon, B2W, Mercado Livre, Magalu) in a decoupled way, making it easy to
        scale
        and add new marketplaces.</li>
    <li>Built core functionality using RabbitMQ and an event-driven architecture, allowing us to scale the system and
        add new
        components without disrupting existing ones.</li>

    operations, and software development. This experience helped me adopt a product-first mindset and effectively
    translate
    business demands into actionable requirements.
