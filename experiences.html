        At Glean i'm developing applications in a fast paced way, powered in a way by the relational
approach of design and FastAPI's lean structure. My primary job here is to implement APIs for
the frontend to consume.
<br>
For the first time, i've been using more complex SQL without ORMs. Here i'm also more
immersed on the infrastructure, and i'm learning Infrastructure as Code.

        In 2019 i joined the backend team at Nodis. Alongside the team i developed applications
from end to end, using Domain Driven Design (DDD) principles and focusing a lot on code
quality, keeping high code coverage and componentization, using microservices and
event-driven architecture, as well as some patterns like event sourcing.
<br>
There i developed many APIs and workers and created many integrations with partner APIs.
<br>
Also, for the first time i engaged more and more in architecture decisions and on mentoring
new developers.

        In 2017 i had my first experience in a tech company. At Walltime, i had contact with all
the areas in such a company, like customer support, operations and finally software development.
<br>
I've dealt with new technologies like Blockchain and also developed a deep understanding
about how to turn business demands into proper requirements and execute them.
<br>
I used Python a lot there, delivering side applications that were used by the operations team,
and also employed some data analysis to extract certain business KPIs. Another thing was
a couple of web scrapers that provided invaluable data to the company.
<br>
There i was mentored in Software Development the first time, and got the needed guidance to
keep learning and developing myself.
