                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <h4>Programming Language</h4>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
    I've started using Python on my college around 2015, working mostly on using it
    as a MATLAB alternative for simulations. After a while, i discovered its power as a
    scripting language, and at that time i joined my first tech company.
</p>
<p>
    I used it to consume external APIs, scrape websites and so on. The next logical step
    was tackling on the web development side, and i started developing websites and APIs.
    I also used it a lot to develop background workers to perform tasks on the background of
    distributed systems.
</p>
        </div>

        
        <div class="major-tech-detail">
            <div class="tech-header">
                <img class="icon" src=assets/images/fastapi_icon.png>
                <div class="tech-title">
                    <h3>FastAPI</h3>
                    <h4>Web Framework</h4>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
    I loved FastAPI at first glance! The way it leverages Pydantic models to perform serialization and automatically
    generate
    documentation is pretty neat. It has since become my favorite tool for building REST APIs with Python.
</p>
<p>
    It also provides a plug-and-play solution for dependency injection which doesn't involve any huge hassle to setup,
    so in
    my opinion that's another plus.

            <div class="tech-header">

            </div>
            <p>
    I started my journey with relational databases using mostly ORM's because they already implement the good practices
    for you on the background. So in reality, it was easy and safe to use and it also points you in the right direction
    for having a good database model.
</p>
<p>
    But one thing that i learned was that ORMs are not a silver bullet and then i had
    to dive deeper into raw SQL, specially when more complex relationships between tables happen or when the queries
    themselves start to become too complex. To this day, i wouldn't say i'm a superstar in SQL, but i'm very capable of
    safely designing and consuming any database.

                    <h3>RabbitMQ</h3>
                    <h4>Message Broker</h4>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
    I've used RabbitMQ as the backbone of an event-driven architecture system and
    used a lot of its features to solve the distributed problems in a scalable way.
    The way exchanges work makes it very easy to plug new applications as subscribers
    of old events without having any impact on the previous behavior.
</p>
<p>
    Some cool things i developed on it include a scheduled queue to regularly perform tasks in
    a scalable way, where the scheduled tasks can be divided among many workers, and also
    increasing back-off time retry queues, also making it possible to scale the workers without
    creating any side effects.

                    <h3>Django</h3>

    One thing that i always liked about Django is how easy it is to setup a simple website
    with it. I started using it on my undergraduate thesis where i had to create an application
    that performed earthing grids simulations and returned a project to the user. I had most
    of the code that did the calculations working, but i still needed to figure out an interface
    for the program and i had a really tight schedule.
</p>
<p>
    In two weeks i was able to learn the framework and get the application running, albeit not
    doing it the best way the first time. With time i was able to study more about it and worked
    some POCs on it. It brings everything to the table, so you can focus on the domain of your
    application.
</p>
<p>
    Another piece i loved in Django was Django Rest Framework (DRF). It applied all of the benefits
    of using Django on developing APIs as well.

            </div>
            <p>
    MongoDB was one of the first databases i ever used, due to being easy to setup and use right
    out of the box. It surely taught me some lessons, specially about performance and how to
    optimize queries and pagination, designing the right schema and filters, and concurrency.
    Also with MongoDB i had the first contact with atomic operations and also with geolocation queries.
</p>
<p>
    One of the coolest things i could do with it is develop a multi-cursor pagination wrapper over
    the Python lib mongoengine.
