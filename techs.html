                <h3>Python</h3>
                <h4>Programming Language</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        I've started using Python on my college around 2015, working mostly on using it
as a MATLAB alternative for simulations. After a while, i discovered its power as a
scripting language, and at that time i joined my first tech company.
<br>
I used it to consume external APIs, scrape websites and so on. The next logical step
was tackling on the web development side, and i started developing websites and APIs.
I also used it a lot to develop background workers to perform tasks on the background of
distributed systems.

    <div class="major-tech-detail">
        <div class="tech-header">
            <img class="icon" src=assets/images/django_icon.png>
            <div class="tech-title">
                <h3>Django</h3>
                <h4>Web Framework</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        One thing that i always liked about Django is how easy it is to setup a simple website
with it. I started using it on my undergraduate thesis where i had to create an application
that performed earthing grids simulations and returned a project to the user. I had most
of the code that did the calculations working, but i still needed to figure out an interface
for the program and i had a really tight schedule.
<br>
In two weeks i was able to learn the framework and get the application running, albeit not
doing it the best way the first time. With time i was able to study more about it and worked
some POCs on it. It brings everything to the table, so you can focus on the domain of your
application.
<br>
Another piece i loved in Django was Django Rest Framework (DRF). It applied all of the benefits
of using Django on developing APIs as well.

    <div class="major-tech-detail">
        <div class="tech-header">

            <div class="tech-title">
                <h3>Flask</h3>
                <h4>Web Framework</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        On the opposite side of Django there's Flask, a minimalistic framework. I've used it
professionally for almost two years, and by being very lightweight, it gives you plenty of
room to build an entire framework around it. It provides you with only the essential tools
to run an API, but it's very extensible and i had much success with it on a distributed
architecture, because Flask was only a piece of the application that had the sole responsibility
of serving the API.

    <div class="major-tech-detail">
        <div class="tech-header">
            <img class="icon" src=assets/images/mongodb_icon.png>
            <div class="tech-title">
                <h3>MongoDB</h3>
                <h4>Non-SQL Database</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        MongoDB was one of the first databases i ever used, due to being easy to setup and use right
out of the box. It surely taught me some lessons, specially about performance and how to
optimize queries and pagination, designing the right schema and filters, and concurrency.
Also with MongoDB i had the first contact with atomic operations and also with geolocation queries.
<br>
One of the coolest things i could do with it is develop a multi-cursor pagination wrapper over
the Python lib mongoengine.

                <h3>RabbitMQ</h3>
                <h4>Message Broker</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        I've used RabbitMQ as the backbone of an event-driven architecture system and
used a lot of its features to solve the distributed problems in a scalable way.
The way exchanges work makes it very easy to plug new applications as subscribers
of old events without having any impact on the previous behavior.
<br>
Some cool things i developed on it include a scheduled queue to regularly perform tasks in
a scalable way, where the scheduled tasks can be divided among many workers, and also
increasing back-off time retry queues, also making it possible to scale the workers without
creating any side effects.
